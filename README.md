# Backend
This nodejs-backend uses some ES6 (not everything is usable yet :/ ) and listen on an IPv6 Socket.

# Starting
Starting this requires the 'vagrant-triggers' plugin.
Please install via:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers
```

If you want to run this, simply run the following command and the nodejs-server is started for you.

```bash
vagrant up
```
